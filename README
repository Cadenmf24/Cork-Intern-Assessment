After working on this for ~ an hour here is my progress report.

This is my first time using SQLite and it is a very unique way of functioning. (Stack OverFlow was my best friend)
Most of my time spent was understanding and learning how SQLite work. I have created helper functions in order to make visiability easier.

Most of my functioning are self explaintory, but those that are not I have commented on them what they do and how they function.

If i had more time, I would be able to complete getting a singular asset along with properly implementing a delete and update function


Instructions:

Run server.py

Once it has ran, you can add /cyberassets to the end of the url to get the list of all the assets I included

for the sake of testing, the sql builds everything and then once the server closes, it will delete the tables
    You can find more detail on that in (schema.sql)

If you are interested in the helper function it is located in (dbUtil.py)
    This is what I used for my SQL project on my resume, it clears up some clutter
